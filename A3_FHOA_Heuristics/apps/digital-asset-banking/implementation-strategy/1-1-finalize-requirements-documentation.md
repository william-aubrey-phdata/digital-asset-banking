# 1.1 Requirements Documentation Strategy for DAB Project

## Overview

This document outlines the strategy for creating comprehensive requirements documentation for the Digital Asset Banking (DAB) project, building upon the existing user stories and project specifications.

---

## 1. Foundation: Leveraging Existing User Stories

The project already has well-structured user stories that provide an excellent foundation:

- Clear actor identification
- Feature IDs and naming conventions
- MoSCoW prioritization (Must, Should, Could, Won't)
- Detailed acceptance criteria
- Dependencies tracking

These user stories should be preserved and extended rather than replaced.

---

## 2. User Story Evaluation and Development

### 2.1 Review of Existing User Stories

1. **Coverage Analysis**
   - Map existing user stories against project objectives
   - Identify functional areas with insufficient coverage
   - Ensure all user roles/personas are represented
   - Verify that critical system interactions are captured

2. **Quality Assessment**
   - Evaluate user stories against INVEST criteria (Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable)
   - Check for clear acceptance criteria
   - Validate priority assignments (MoSCoW)
   - Review dependencies for accuracy and completeness

3. **Consistency Check**
   - Ensure consistent formatting across all user stories
   - Verify consistent terminology usage
   - Check for duplicate or overlapping stories
   - Validate feature ID naming conventions

### 2.2 Gap Identification

1. **Functional Gaps**
   - Core business processes not covered by existing stories
   - Edge cases and exception handling
   - System integrations and data flows
   - Administrative and maintenance functions

2. **Non-Functional Aspects**
   - Performance expectations
   - Security requirements
   - Compliance needs
   - Accessibility considerations
   - Internationalization/localization needs

3. **User Journey Mapping**
   - Create end-to-end user journeys
   - Identify missing steps in workflows
   - Ensure logical progression between related stories
   - Validate completeness of user experiences

### 2.3 Creating New User Stories

1. **Story Writing Workshops**
   - Schedule dedicated sessions with stakeholders
   - Use structured templates for consistency
   - Focus on user value and outcomes
   - Capture acceptance criteria during creation

2. **Story Format Standards**
   - Maintain the established YAML format
   - Follow the "As a [role], I want [goal], so that [benefit]" structure
   - Include all required metadata (ID, priority, dependencies)
   - Ensure testable acceptance criteria

3. **Prioritization Process**
   - Evaluate business value vs. implementation effort
   - Consider dependencies and technical constraints
   - Apply consistent MoSCoW criteria
   - Get stakeholder consensus on priorities

### 2.4 Validation and Refinement

1. **Stakeholder Review**
   - Present new and revised user stories to stakeholders
   - Gather feedback on accuracy and completeness
   - Validate priorities and dependencies
   - Document approval or required changes

2. **Technical Feasibility Assessment**
   - Review with development team
   - Identify technical constraints or challenges
   - Refine stories based on implementation considerations
   - Document assumptions and technical notes

3. **Final User Story Baseline**
   - Consolidate all approved user stories
   - Establish version control for the user story inventory
   - Create a baseline for requirements development
   - Document the process for future user story additions or changes

## 3. Requirements Documentation Structure

### 3.1 Requirements Traceability Matrix

Create a matrix that maps:
- User stories to technical requirements
- Requirements to verification methods
- Requirements to test cases
- Requirements to implementation status

### 3.2 Requirements Categorization

Group requirements into four main categories:

1. **Functional Requirements**
   - Derived directly from user stories
   - Organized by functional domain (asset management, transactions, etc.)

2. **Non-Functional Requirements**
   - Performance specifications
   - Security requirements
   - Compliance needs
   - Scalability parameters

3. **Technical Requirements**
   - Infrastructure specifications
   - Integration points
   - Development standards
   - Deployment requirements

4. **Data Requirements**
   - Data model specifications
   - ETL process requirements
   - Data quality standards
   - Reporting needs

## 4. Documentation Process

### 4.1 Gap Analysis

1. Review existing user stories against the comprehensive requirements framework
2. Identify missing requirements (especially non-functional ones)
3. Document assumptions that need validation
4. Prioritize gaps to be addressed

### 4.2 Collaborative Refinement

1. Hold workshops with stakeholders to validate requirements
2. Use the user stories as discussion points
3. Document decisions and open questions
4. Iterate on requirements based on feedback

### 4.3 Requirements Validation

1. Review requirements for:
   - Completeness
   - Consistency
   - Testability
   - Feasibility
2. Resolve conflicts and ambiguities
3. Get stakeholder sign-off on final requirements

## 5. Requirements Management

### 5.1 Living Documentation

- Maintain requirements as living documents
- Use version control to track changes
- Update as the project evolves
- Link requirements to implementation artifacts

### 5.2 Traceability

- Maintain bidirectional traceability:
  - From user stories to requirements
  - From requirements to design
  - From requirements to code
  - From requirements to tests

### 5.3 Change Management

- Document the process for changing requirements
- Assess impact of changes on project scope, timeline, and resources
- Maintain a change log
- Update dependent documentation when requirements change

## 7. Tools and Templates

### 7.1 Recommended Tools

- Version-controlled markdown files (GitHub/GitLab)
- Spreadsheets for traceability matrices
- Jira for requirements tracking (optional)
- Confluence for documentation (optional)

### 7.2 Templates

## 8. Success Criteria

The requirements documentation strategy will be considered successful when:

1. All user stories are mapped to specific, testable requirements
2. Requirements are categorized and prioritized
3. Stakeholders have reviewed and approved the requirements
4. Traceability is established between requirements and other project artifacts
5. The requirements baseline is established before development begins
6. A process is in place for managing requirements changes
