# Digital Asset Banking - Ontologics

## Overview

This directory contains the ontological components of the Digital Asset Banking application. Ontologics represent the data models, relationships, and semantic structures that define the system.

## Purpose

The ontologics layer focuses on:

- Data models and schemas for digital assets
- Entity relationships between users, assets, and transactions
- Semantic definitions of asset types and properties
- Taxonomies for categorizing digital content

## Contents

- `/models` - Core data models and schemas
- `/relationships` - Entity relationship definitions
- `/semantics` - Semantic views and definitions

## Integration

Ontological models provide the structural foundation that heuristics operate on, and that analytics measure and report against. This layer includes the Snowflake database schemas, views, and semantic models.
