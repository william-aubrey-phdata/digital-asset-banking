# Naming the Agentic Insight Motor (AIM)

*   **Date**: July 28, 2025
*   **Agent**: Gemini Code Assist
*   **Related Models**: `A1-analytics.md`, `A3-heuristics.md`

## 1. Objective

To establish a formal, three-word name for the FHOA analytics engine, consistent with the project's naming conventions. This provides a strong identity, improves communication, and aligns with the established pattern of names that offer both conceptual meaning and a short, memorable acronym.

---

## 2. Proposal & Reasoning

The proposed and accepted name for the analytics engine is the **Agentic Insight Motor (AIM)**.

This name was chosen for the following reasons:

*   **Agentic**: This directly ties into the core philosophy of the FHOA framework as an "agentic operating system." It signifies that the analytics engine is an active participant in the improvement cycle, designed to work collaboratively with both human and AI agents.

*   **Insight**: This focuses on the crucial output of the entire `A1: Conduct Analytics` process. The engine doesn't just produce data or metrics; its ultimate purpose is to generate actionable `Improvement Insights` that drive the refinement of the Ontologics layer.

*   **Motor**: This is a powerful and fitting synonym for "engine." It implies the component that imparts motion and drives the entire FHOA "Ouroboros Cycle." It's the force that propels the system's continuous improvement.

The resulting acronym, **AIM**, is particularly strong, implying purpose, direction, and precisionâ€”the very qualities desired in a system designed to identify and target areas for improvement.

## 3. Formalization in the Ontology

To codify this decision within the FHOA framework, the `A1-analytics.md` process model was updated to include a "Nomenclature" note. This ensures the name is officially part of the system's conceptual blueprint.
