# Digital Asset Banking - Heuristics

## Overview

This directory contains the heuristic components of the Digital Asset Banking application. Heuristics represent the functional problem-solving approaches and patterns used within the system.

## Purpose

The heuristics layer focuses on:

- Practical algorithms for digital asset management
- Problem-solving methodologies for asset creation and trading
- Functional patterns for data banking operations
- Decision-making processes for physical card generation

## Contents

- `/algorithms` - Core algorithms for asset processing
- `/patterns` - Reusable functional patterns
- `/rules` - Business rules and decision logic

## Integration

Heuristics components integrate with the ontological models to provide functional operations on the defined data structures, and feed into analytics for performance measurement and optimization.
