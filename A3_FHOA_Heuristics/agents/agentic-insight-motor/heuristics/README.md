# Agentic Insight Motor - Heuristics

## Overview

This directory contains the heuristic components of the Agentic Insight Motor application. Heuristics represent the functional problem-solving approaches, algorithms, and reasoning patterns used by the agent.

## Purpose

The heuristics layer focuses on:

- Algorithmic approaches for insight generation
- Decision-making frameworks for agent actions
- Pattern recognition methodologies
- Reasoning models and inference engines
- Learning mechanisms and adaptation strategies

## Contents

- `/algorithms` - Core algorithms for insight processing
- `/reasoning` - Reasoning models and inference patterns
- `/learning` - Learning mechanisms and adaptation strategies
- `/decision` - Decision-making frameworks and evaluation metrics

## Integration

Heuristics components provide the functional intelligence that operates on the ontological data structures. They implement the reasoning patterns that transform raw data into actionable insights, which are then measured and evaluated through the analytics layer.
