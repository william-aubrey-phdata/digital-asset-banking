# Agentic Insight Motor - Ontologics

## Overview

This directory contains the ontological components of the Agentic Insight Motor application. Ontologics represent the knowledge structures, data models, and semantic frameworks that define the agent's understanding of its domain.

## Purpose

The ontologics layer focuses on:

- Knowledge representation schemas
- Entity relationships and concept hierarchies
- Semantic networks and knowledge graphs
- Domain-specific taxonomies and vocabularies
- Data models for insight representation

## Contents

- `/models` - Core data models and knowledge schemas
- `/semantics` - Semantic networks and knowledge graphs
- `/taxonomies` - Domain taxonomies and classification systems
- `/relationships` - Entity relationship definitions

## Integration

Ontological models provide the structural foundation for the agent's understanding of its domain. They define the conceptual framework that heuristics operate on and that analytics measure. This includes database schemas, knowledge graphs, and semantic models that represent the agent's knowledge base.
