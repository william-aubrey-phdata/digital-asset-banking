# FHOA Heuristics (A3.1) Process Model: Design & Develop Application

This document provides the IDEF0-style decomposition for the **A3.1: Design & Develop Application** function within the FHOA framework. Its purpose is to detail the sub-processes involved in transforming a conceptual model into functional, tested source code.

---

## A3.1: Design & Develop Application (Top-Level Function)

- **Purpose**: To transform a conceptual process model and a set of requirements into functional, tested source code.
- **Inputs**: Conceptual Process Models (from A2), User Stories [`cite: user-stories.md`]
- **Controls**: Architectural Specifications [`cite: dab-specifications.md`], Source Code Version Control
- **Outputs**: Application Source Code, Unit & Integration Tests
- **Mechanisms**: Software Developer, AI Assistant (Gemini), VS Code IDE, Git Repository

## A3.1 Decomposition: The Software Development Lifecycle

The A3.1 function is decomposed into four sequential activities that represent the core loop of modern software development.

### A3.1.1: Translate Requirements into Technical Design

- **Purpose**: To analyze the conceptual model and user stories to create a detailed technical plan for implementation.
- **Inputs**: `Conceptual Process Models` (from A2), `User Stories`
- **Controls**: `Architectural Specifications`, `Developer Experience & Knowledge`
- **Outputs**: `Technical Design Document`, `Task Breakdown (e.g., tickets)`
- **Mechanisms**: `Software Developer`, `AI Assistant (Gemini)`, `Whiteboard/Diagramming Tool`

### A3.1.2: Write Application Code

- **Purpose**: To implement the features described in the technical design by writing source code.
- **Inputs**: `Technical Design Document` (from A3.1.1)
- **Controls**: `Programming Language Standards`, `Project Coding Conventions`
- **Outputs**: `Draft Application Source Code`
- **Mechanisms**: `Software Developer`, `AI Assistant (Gemini)`, `VS Code IDE`

### A3.1.3: Write & Execute Tests

- **Purpose**: To verify that the written code meets requirements and is free of defects.
- **Inputs**: `Draft Application Source Code` (from A3.1.2), `Technical Design Document` (from A3.1.1)
- **Controls**: `Testing Framework`, `Code Coverage Targets`
- **Outputs**: `Tested Application Source Code`, `Test Results`
- **Mechanisms**: `Software Developer`, `AI Assistant (Gemini)`, `Pytest/Unit Test Runner`

### A3.1.4: Review & Commit Code

- **Purpose**: To perform a quality check on the code and tests, and merge them into the main codebase.
- **Inputs**: `Tested Application Source Code` (from A3.1.3), `Test Results`
- **Controls**: `Peer Review Guidelines`, `Source Code Version Control (Git)`
- **Outputs**: `Application Source Code` (to A3.2), `Unit & Integration Tests` (to A3.2)
- **Mechanisms**: `Peer Developers`, `Git Repository (e.g., GitHub)`, `CI System`
