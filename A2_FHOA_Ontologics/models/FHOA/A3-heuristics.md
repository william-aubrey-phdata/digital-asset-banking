# Chapter 3.3: FHOA Heuristics (A3) Process Model

This document provides the IDEF0-style decomposition for the **A3: Execute Heuristics** function within the FHOA framework. Its primary purpose is to build, deploy, and operate the tangible software applications that solve real-world problems and generate performance data.

---

## A3: Execute Heuristics (Top-Level Function)

- **Purpose**: To translate conceptual process models into functional, deployed applications (codified heuristics) that interact with agents and the physical world, executing tasks and generating raw performance data as a primary output [`cite: the-FHOA-framework.md`].
- **Inputs**: Conceptual Process Models (from A2 Ontologics), Real-World Problems
- **Controls**: Architectural Specifications, User Stories & Requirements [`cite: dab-specifications.md`]
- **Outputs**: Raw Transactional & Performance Data (to A1 Analytics), Business Outcomes
- **Mechanisms**: Software Development Teams, AI Assistants, Cloud Infrastructure, CI/CD Pipeline

> **Note on Recursion**: The FHOA framework is recursive. The Analytics Engine (the `Data Pipeline Engine`, `BI Tools`, etc. that serve as mechanisms for A1) is itself a complex Heuristic. Therefore, the process of *building the analytics engine* is an instance of this A3 process, controlled by its own conceptual models from A2 (e.g., `dimensions_of_quality_in_a_data_pipeline.md`). The "operation" of this specific heuristic (A3.3) is the A1 function itself, creating a meta-feedback loop.

## A3 Decomposition: The Lifecycle of a Heuristic (Application)

The A3 function is decomposed into four activities that represent the lifecycle of designing, deploying, and operating a software application.

---

### A3.1: Design & Develop Application

- **Purpose**: To transform a conceptual process model and a set of requirements into functional, tested source code.
- **Inputs**: Conceptual Process Models (from A2), User Stories [`cite: user-stories.md`]
- **Controls**: Architectural Specifications [`cite: dab-specifications.md`], Source Code Version Control
- **Outputs**: Application Source Code, Unit & Integration Tests
- **Mechanisms**: Software Developer, AI Assistant (Gemini), VS Code IDE, Git Repository

---

### A3.2: Deploy Application

- **Purpose**: To package the application source code and its dependencies and deploy it to the target production environment.
- **Inputs**: Application Source Code (from A3.1)
- **Controls**: CI/CD Pipeline Configuration, Infrastructure-as-Code Files [`cite: dab-specifications.md`]
- **Outputs**: Deployed Application, Deployment Logs
- **Mechanisms**: CI/CD Pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions), Containerization Engine (e.g., Docker), Target Compute Service (e.g., AWS Lambda)

---

### A3.3: Operate Application

- **Purpose**: To execute the deployed application, allowing agents (human or AI) to interact with it to solve real-world problems.
- **Inputs**: User Requests, Agent Interactions
- **Controls**: RBAC Policies, Service Level Agreements (SLAs) [`cite: dab-specifications.md`]
- **Outputs**: Business Outcomes (e.g., a created digital asset), Application Logs
- **Mechanisms**: End Users, AI Agents, Cloud Infrastructure

---

### A3.4: Generate Performance Data

- **Purpose**: To capture detailed metrics, logs, and transactional data from the operating application, producing the raw material for the Analytics layer.
- **Inputs**: Business Outcomes & Application Logs (from A3.3)
- **Controls**: Monitoring & Logging Configuration, Data Model Schema [`cite: snowflake-data-model.md`]
- **Outputs**: Raw Transactional & Performance Data (the primary input for A1 Analytics)
- **Mechanisms**: Cloud Monitoring Tools (e.g., CloudWatch), Logging Services, Backend API
