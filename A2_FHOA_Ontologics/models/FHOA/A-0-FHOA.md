# IDEF0 Process Model for the FHOA Framework

This document provides a hierarchical decomposition of the processes for the Functional Heuristics, Ontologics, and Analytics (FHOA) framework, following the IDEF0 methodology.

## A-0: Execute Continuous System Improvement (Context Diagram)

This is the highest-level view, defining the overall scope and boundary of the FHOA system.

* **Function Name**: Execute Continuous System Improvement
* **Purpose**: To provide a structured, agentic operating system for analyzing, optimizing, and evolving enterprise processes through a recursive feedback loop.
* **Viewpoint**: From the perspective of the agentic-activated enterprise.

### ICOMs (Inputs, Controls, Outputs, Mechanisms)

#### Inputs
* `Business Problems & Goals`: The strategic objectives that initiate process modeling and improvement cycles.
* `Raw Performance Data`: The unanalyzed data generated by operational systems.

#### Controls
* `FHOA Framework Principles`: The core concepts of the three-layer (Analytics, Ontologics, Heuristics) system that govern its operation.
* `Business Strategy & Constraints`: The overarching business rules, budgets, and goals that guide decision-making.

#### Outputs
* `Refined System Processes`: The improved and optimized business processes, codified in the Ontologics layer.
* `Actionable Improvement Insights`: Data-driven recommendations for process changes.
* `Performance Dashboards`: Visualizations of system performance against defined models.

#### Mechanisms
* `Human & AI Agents`: The actors who execute, analyze, and refine processes within the framework.
* `Ontologics Layer (Models)`: The repository of formal process definitions.
* `Heuristics Layer (Tools)`: The applications and systems that execute processes.
* `Analytics Layer (Engine)`: The data pipelines and BI tools that measure performance.

## A0: Execute Continuous System Improvement (Decomposition)

This diagram breaks down the A-0 box into its three core FHOA functions, illustrating the "Ouroboros Cycle" of continuous improvement.

* **A1: Conduct Analytics**: Transforms raw data from heuristic execution into actionable insights by comparing performance against conceptual models.
    * **Inputs**: `Raw Transactional & Performance Data` (from A3)
    * **Controls**: `Conceptual Process Models` (from A2)
    * **Outputs**: `Improvement Insights`, `Performance Dashboards`
    * **Mechanisms**: `Data Pipeline Engine`, `BI Tools`, `Data Analysts`

* **A2: Manage Ontologics**: Creates, refines, and governs the formal conceptual models (the "blueprints") of all system processes.
    * **Inputs**: `Improvement Insights` (from A1), `Business Problems & Goals`
    * **Controls**: `FHOA Framework Principles`
    * **Outputs**: `Conceptual Process Models` (to control A1 and A3), `Refined System Processes`
    * **Mechanisms**: `Process Analysts`, `IDEF0 Modeling Tools`, `Model Repository (Snowflake)`

* **A3: Execute Heuristics**: Executes defined processes using instrumented tools and applications, generating the raw data needed for the analytics layer.
    * **Inputs**: `User/System Trigger`
    * **Controls**: `Conceptual Process Models` (from A2)
    * **Outputs**: `Raw Transactional & Performance Data` (to A1), `Process Outcome`
    * **Mechanisms**: `Software Applications`, `End Users & AI Agents`, `Systems of Record`

## A1: Conduct Analytics (Decomposition)

This decomposition is detailed in the **FHOA Analytics (A1) Process Model**. The four sub-functions are:

* **A1.1: Perform Descriptive Analytics** (What happened?)
* **A1.2: Perform Diagnostic Analytics** (Why did it happen?)
* **A1.3: Perform Predictive Analytics** (What will happen?)
* **A1.4: Perform Prescriptive Analytics** (What should we do about it?)

## A2: Manage Ontologics (Decomposition)

This diagram details the lifecycle of a conceptual process model.

### A2.1: Model New Process
* **Purpose**: To capture an undocumented business process in a formal IDEF0 model.
* **Inputs**: `Business Problem & Goals`
* **Controls**: `IDEF0 Modeling Standards`, `Domain Expert Knowledge`
* **Outputs**: `Initial Process Model`
* **Mechanisms**: `Process Analyst`, `Modeling Tool`

### A2.2: Refine Existing Process Model
* **Purpose**: To update a process model based on data-driven insights from the Analytics layer.
* **Inputs**: `Improvement Insights` (from A1)
* **Controls**: `Existing Process Model`, `Business Constraints`
* **Outputs**: `Updated Process Model`, `Change Log`
* **Mechanisms**: `Process Analyst`, `Decision Scientist`

### A2.3: Publish Process Models
* **Purpose**: To make the official version of a process model available as a control for the Heuristics and Analytics layers.
* **Inputs**: `Approved Process Model`
* **Controls**: `Governance Policy`
* **Outputs**: `Published Conceptual Process Model`
* **Mechanisms**: `Model Repository (Snowflake)`, `CI/CD Pipeline`

### A3.2: Execute Process via Tool
* **Purpose**: The operational use of the heuristic tool by an agent to perform a task.
* **Inputs**: `User/System Trigger`
* **Controls**: `Published Conceptual Process Model` (from A2)
* **Outputs**: `Process Outcome`, `Raw Execution Events`
* **Mechanisms**: `End User / AI Agent`, `Operational Heuristic Tool`
